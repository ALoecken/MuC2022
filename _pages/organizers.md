<p><b>Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs)</b>: Non-motorized road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, motorcyclists, and persons with disabilities, reduced mobility, or reduced orientation [<a href='/References/#connell1997'>Connell1997</a>]. This workshop specifically focuses on especially vulnerable road users eVRUs [<a href='/References/#hollaender2021'>Hollaender2021</a>] like children, older adults or people with impairments.</p>
<p><b>External Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs)</b>: </p>"

*Mathias Haimerl*,  (main contact) is a PhD candidate at the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI). His research looks into inclusion aspects of eHMIs. *Contact: mathias.haimerl@<span style="display:none;">thisisnotpartofthedomain-</span>thi.<span style="display:none;">thisnoteither-</span>de*

**Mark Colley** is a PhD candidate at the University of Ulm. His research looks into communication possibilities between AVs and VRUs such as pedestrians and cyclists. *Contact: mark.colley@<span style="display:none;">thisisnotpartofthedomain-</span>uni-ulm.<span style="display:none;">thisnoteither-</span>de*

**Andreas LÃ¶cken** is a postdoctoral researcher in the HCI group at the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI). His research focuses on Human-Computer Interfaces in sociotechnical safety-critical systems in general, and specifically the interaction between VRUs and AVs. *Contact: andreas.loecken@<span style="display:none;">thisisnotpartofthedomain-</span>thi.<span style="display:none;">thisnoteither-</span>de*

**Andreas Riener** is professor for Human Machine Interface and Virtual Reality at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI) with co-appointment at the CARISSMA research center. His research interests include driving ergonomics, driver state assessment from physiological measures and trust, acceptance, and ethics in automated driving. *Contact: andreas.riener@<span style="display:none;">thisisnotpartofthedomain-</span>thi.<span style="display:none;">thisnoteither-</span>de*

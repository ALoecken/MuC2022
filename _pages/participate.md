This workshop invites people from different cultures, backgrounds, and affiliations to explore the interplay of automated vehicles and other road users.
The workshop emphasizes differences in abilities, diversity, and inclusive design solutions for the interaction of AVs and VRUs.
We welcome researchers and practitioners with interest in accessible technology, automotive user interfaces, 
interactive technologies for blind or deaf people, people with reduced mobility (PRM), seniors, or people with other impairments themselves.
We want to foster new ideas and approaches to make the future traffic more accessible, so anyone who wants to discuss ideas is welcome.

## Participation
You have three options for participation:
* Submit a position paper
* Submit an abstract for your lightning talk
* Participate without presenting your position

Please register for the workshop via the [Mensch und Computer 2022 Conftool](https://www.conftool.com/muc2022/).
1. After registration, you must validate your e-mail address and are provided with a password.
1. Scroll down and select **MCI-WS09 - Accessible Automated Automotive Workshop Series (A3WS): Focus External Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs)**.
1. You will be guided through the process.

## Contribution Submission
Participants are invited to submit three-minute videos or position papers.
Each paper will be reviewed by at least two organizers of this workshop with regard to its contribution to the workshop.
**All accepted submissions will be published online** before the beginning of the workshop and in the workshop proceedings.
The Paper format follows the ACM proceedings format and is provided for [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc), [LaTeX](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip), and [Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx).
The CCS-concepts can be removed. Lightning talks do not need to be submitted as PDF; an abstract in the Conftool suffices.

## Goals of the Workshop
We intend to achieve the following goals with this workshop:
1.	Provide an overview of the current state of the research for inclusive eHMIs.
2.	Identify the research gap and raise awareness for lowering the barriers to traffic participation.
3.	Gathering experiences, concerns and live feedback on inclusion of eHMIs.
4.	Establish communication with workshop attendees for future national and international collaborations.

### Workshop Topics
Potential topics to be discussed at the workshop include, but are not limited to:
* Overview of the current state and research gaps in research on inclusion of eHMIs
* Communication concepts for user groups with diverse limitations, such as
    * Reduced mobility
    * Impaired vision
    * Cognitive or intellectual disorders
    * Children and seniors
    * ...
* Approaches for future communication with eVRUs

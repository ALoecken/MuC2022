<p> <span style="font-size: 1.5em">Accessible Automated Automotive Workshop Series (A3WS) – Focus External Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs)</span><br/>
In conjunction with Mensch und Computer 2022, September 4-7, Virtual Conference.</p>

**Note:** Participants are invited to submit a position paper before the workshop. See [Participate](/Participate) for more details. {: .notice--danger}

With modernizing traffic, a rise of automated vehicles (AVs) is expected.
As AVs potentially need to communicate their intentions, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) seem to be an appropriate solution.

While automotive research progresses quickly, people with special needs (PSN) are vastly underrepresented.
With an aging population due to demographic changes and advances in medical treatments and with the stride towards equality and accessibility, the needs of these groups also have to be considered in the automotive domain.

We provide an inclusive platform for interdisciplinary exchange on current and future topics, especially for academia, industry, and politics.
This enables different perspectives with particular (but not exclusive) regard to user experience (UX) and psychology, product design, legislative concerns and, thus, support the communication and potentially founding of new topic streams.
The aim is to create new interdisciplinary networks and collaborations to make future developments on vehicle-to-human (V2H) communication more inclusive.
